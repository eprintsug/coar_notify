# COAR Notify

Implementation of the [COAR Notify protocol](https://notify.coar-repositories.org/)

## Dependencies

Depends on a [signposting](https://signposting.org/) enabled EPrints

Either for [EPrints 3.3.x](https://github.com/eprintsug/ulcc-core)

Or for [EPrints 3.4.x](https://github.com/eprints/eprints3.4/pull/387) (Pull request)

## Nice to haves

For a notification UI for EPrints, in case a human needs to read or otherwise interact with COARNotify, we recommend using the [EPrints Notification plugin](https://github.com/eprintsug/notifications)
